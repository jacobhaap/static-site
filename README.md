## J3 - Static Site

This project is a static version of my [Personal Website](https://gitlab.com/j3x/site), a React site that renders each page from Markdown documents. This static version was created by extracting the outer HTML of the rendered Markdown with some minor tweaks, and reworked JavaScript for the **Jacob Standard Time** and **Last Song** features on the `/info` page. These are powered by [J3 API](https://gitlab.com/j3x/api).

The purpose of the static site is to introduce support for browsers without JavaScript enabled, and to support a decentralized version that can be content addressed by protocols like IPFS.
